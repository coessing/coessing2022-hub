    "## What is git?\n",
    "\n",
    "`Git` is a tool for versioning of files. It is commonly used in programming, but can actually be used to version control any files! \n",
    "\n",
    "What is version control? You may be familiar with the problem of naming and renaming documents when you think you have a final version. E.g. \"final_paper.doc\" but then you find another typo so you save the new one as \"final_paper2.doc\", but then your advisor suggests you add a new paragraph so you have another file named \"FINAL_paper.doc\", and so on. ðŸ™ƒ\n",
    "\n",
    "`Git` (and other version control) allows you to keep the same saved name of your file, but saves the changes that you make. So you can create checkpoints while working on a document such that you cannot lose your progress. This means that `git` can also help with recovery of files! If you commit your file to git and then accidentally delete your whole document, you can revive your document from any of the previous checkpoints you made.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how this works in action. There are a couple of ways to use `git`, but I tend to use it through the terminal. ðŸ‘‰ \n",
    "\n",
    "A couple tips:\n",
    "- in general, do not include data in your git repository\n",
    "   - typically, data is not a good candidate for git. Data can be large and usually don't change much, so it's best to leave data out.\n",
    "- you can use git from any server! You can use it on your local computer or here on the Hub!\n",
    "- \"repo\" (short for \"repository\" is essentially a folder. It is used to indicate a folder that has git enabled, and is also used to mean a specific entity on GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installing Git\n",
    "\n",
    "If you use Windows, you will need to download git [here](https://git-scm.com). If you use Linux or Mac, then git is pre-installed."
